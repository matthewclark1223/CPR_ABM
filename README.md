# Data and R code Repository for 'Causal attribution of agricultural expansion in a small island system using approximate Bayesian computation'

The code provided here allows interested readers to run the agent-based model and the approximate Bayesian computation. Data should not be published elsewhere without the explicit permission of the authors.


There are many files in this repository, but the important ones for reproducing the analyses are those listed below
### Files:

* HCRI_Grant > ProjectFiles > Full_LandUse_ABM.R - Code for the agent-based model
* HCRI_Grant > ProjectFiles > ABM_ABC.R - Code for running the approximate Bayesian computation

Also note that both scripts require users to have the 'tidyverse' suite of packages installed along with the 'raster' and 'sf' packages. This code also relies on data produced using the Google Earth Engine scriopt provided.
